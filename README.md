Hey, Creating solutions for SMBs, in the run your business from your phone. Actually see your business being run from your phone, because we automate your business decisions using prescriptive analytics. Most of the decisions are made for you and "queued up" for a few minutes, after which they are automatically executed. You can make changes during the few minutes, or you can choose "categories" where manual intervention is required before a change is implemented or an action is taken.

Automatic discovery and implementation of best practices based on automatic experiments using AI is the way of the solution.

For the end SMB owner or operator, this is a simple phone based interface. All other services are automated or provided as services by us.
The owner can have a slick app (primary) or a text/messaging based interface(secondary)

For the consumers (end customers), usually the important "rising" middle-class customers, it is an extremely slick "uber-like" experience, where all their needs are met magically. i.e. a magical experience.
The consumers can have a "slick" text/messaging based interface(primary) or a slick app(secondary)
